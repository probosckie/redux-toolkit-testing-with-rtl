# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is aimed at :

1. showcasing a simple testing of RTK query based app with React testing library
2. Instead of the approach [here](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-tests) - which advocated creating a store every time for every single test - this repo demonstrates how to use a simple store singleton and dispatch an action to reset the store with initialdata every time - which can save some time.
